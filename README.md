# Net-4-Speed üèéÔ∏è

A thrilling racing game where your internet speed determines how fast your virtual car moves! Compete against dynamic AI opponents while your real-time bandwidth fuels your racing performance.

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Changemakers

### Team Members
- **Team Lead**: Prithvi Bhargav - Govt Model Engineering College, Kochi
- **Member 2**: Adithyan AS - Govt Model Engineering College, Kochi

### Project Description
Net-4-Speed transforms the mundane task of internet speed testing into an exciting racing game! Your actual download and upload speeds directly control your virtual car's performance. Race against AI opponents with dynamic speed variations, navigate through obstacles, and prove your internet connection is the fastest on the track.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Waiting for boring internet speed tests to finish is a drag‚Äîthere's no excitement, no competition, and absolutely zero racing action!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By turning the mundane task of checking your internet speed into a high-stakes racing game! Your internet bandwidth directly fuels your virtual car. The faster your connection, the faster you race. Challenge your friends, climb the leaderboards, and prove that your internet is the fastest of them all!
